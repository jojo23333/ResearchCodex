- [] Comes up with a AGENT.md for codex to use rcodex
- [] Comes up ways human-AI collaboration in Idea & Implemetation Planning Stage

Idea formation -> Implementaion Plans -> Experiment Plans

## Idea planning
- [] Pownder a bit deeper on how human and codex cowork together in the idea planning stage.
  - A few crucial things that can distinguish against other things is the ability to get the correct context in different stage 

* Maybe we start by having some coarse idea, what we lack is contextualize the idea and actually try it.

* Lets started with a well-formed idea? 
*  I feel like I can still use it in current stage as well by setting model to general model.

Coarse idea + Context (Papers, Github, Blog, or Even people's tweets) -> Concrete ideas with setting

## Implementation planning
* May be at this point we start using codex intensively.
Codex will take ideas, and form concrete todos, those todos were sent back to user for reviewing.
* We also want to ultilize past information in the idea implemetation chain to aid implementation in this way in a clean way. 
* speaking of which we may be lack a rcodex reorganize code something like this to reorganze and run all automated test
### Environment setup

### Data / Utility setups

### Core Algorithms

### Testing / Evaluations / Deliverables


## Experiment planning
May be at this stage this is outside of the scope of rcodex.
