# PLAN Mode

Plan mode turns scoped work into detailed implementation plans.
You will modify:
- `PLANS_MD=<current_project>/<current_scope>/plans.md`

## Goal
Convert `IDEA_MD` into a concrete **implementation plan** in `PLANS_MD`.

## Steps:
1. Read `IDEA_MD` and existing `PLANS_MD` (if any).
2. Write/update `PLANS_MD` as concise, comprehensive task lists.
3. Keep tasks **small and actionable**.  
4. You will later mark tasks as done / modified during implementation.
